It has been well-established that behavioral disorders
such as depression and schizophrenia are hard to diagnose.

Classifying the type of the disorder is a challenging task because
of the diversity of the symptoms. Furthermore, estimation of the
severity level of such disorders is another challenging factor in
the diagnosis process. Current clinical diagnostic procedures tend
to be mostly dependent on the self-reporting of patients or the
limited observational evaluations of clinicians. 

There is a
need for objective analytical methods that leverage the current
informatics advancements in studying behavior disorders...a
data-driven approach that takes advantage of the available public
databases to differentiate between multiple behavioral disorders.

establish correlations between mobility and health by analyzing
the mobility data collected from 72 participants suffering from
multiple behavioral disorders using wearable sensors. 

Moreover, the proposed model can add a useful information to
healthcare providers to better diagnose behavioral conditions and
develop data-driven treatment options.
